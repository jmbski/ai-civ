**Country 2: The Sunstone Confederacy**
* **Area:** ~35,000 sq km
* **Location:** Southeastern quadrant of Aerthos, encompassing a large, fertile central plain and leading into gentle foothills.
* **Terrain:** Expansive, sun-drenched plains perfect for grain and livestock production, dotted with small, defensible hills and scattered forests.
* **Government:** Decentralized Confederacy of autonomous city-states and agricultural communities, with a High Council for common defense and trade (its power ebbs and flows).
* **Population:** 750,000 (Moderately populated, fiercely independent city-dwellers and resilient agriculturalists, known for their self-sufficiency.)
* **Economy:** Stable and robust, based almost entirely on immense agricultural output (grain, livestock). Limited industrial capacity, relying on imports for specialized goods.

* **Controlled Grid Cells:** D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, E6, E7, E8, E9, E10, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, J6, J7, J8, J9, J10. (35 Cells)

**Country 3: The Ironclad Marches**
* **Area:** ~20,000 sq km
* **Location:** Northeastern mountains and rugged uplands of Aerthos, extending to a harsh, rocky northern coastline.
* **Terrain:** Dominantly harsh, mineral-rich mountains (iron, coal, tin), deep, cold valleys, and unforgiving rocky coastlines. Features brutal, long winters.
* **Government:** Martial Feudalism, ruled by powerful, ambitious warlords and an elected High Thane who commands their loyalty (for now). Strength and conquest are paramount.
* **Population:** 400,000 (Sparsely populated but exceedingly hardy and militaristic, known for their mining and blacksmithing skills, largely Human and Dwarf clans.)
* **Economy:** Resource-rich (iron, coal, some precious metals), but limited agriculture due to terrain and climate. Relies heavily on trade (or plunder) for food and finished goods.
* **Military:** Highly aggressive, well-equipped, and exceptionally disciplined. Possesses the largest and most experienced professional army on Aerthos, designed for conquest.
    * **Active Standing Military:** 8,000 professional troops, composed of:

* **Key Issues:** Chronic food scarcity and limited arable land constantly drive their expansionist urges. Internal power struggles between rival warlords are common.
* **Diplomatic Relations:** Antagonistic towards the Silver Coast (seen as weak and wealthy), views the Sunstone Confederacy as a potential breadbasket for future conquest, and generally respects overt displays of military strength above all else.
* **Controlled Grid Cells:** G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, J1, J2, J3, J4, J5. (20 Cells)

    * **Active Standing Military:** 1,500 highly specialized units, composed of:
        * 700 [R-E-5] Elven Master Rangers (Exceptional archers and stealth experts)

    * **Conscript/Levy Pool:** Approximately 10,000 others who could be mobilized for basic support, reconnaissance, or temporary defensive roles, often alongside the natural elements, classified as [I-B-2] Woodsfolk Levies.
* **Key Issues:** Growing encroachment from the Ironclad Marches (seeking timber and minerals) and occasional settlers from the Silver Coast. Maintaining their ancient ways and the balance of nature in the face of external pressures.
* **Diplomatic Relations:** Deeply mistrustful of outsiders, prefers to remain isolated, and will defend their territory fiercely using any means available, both natural and magical. They typically only interact when their lands are directly threatened or when the balance of nature is at risk.
* **Controlled Grid Cells:** D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, F1, F2, F3, F4, F5. (20 Cells)

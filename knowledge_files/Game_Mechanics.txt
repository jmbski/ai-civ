## Military Unit Code System


This game uses a 3-part code system to categorize and rank military units for quick interpretation. The format is: `[CATEGORY]-[GEAR_QUALITY]-[SKILL_LEVEL]`.


---


### CATEGORY (First Letter): Defines the primary role or type of the unit.


* **I:** **Infantry** - Melee ground units, such as swordsmen, spearmen, axe-wielders, pikemen, etc.
* **R:** **Ranged** - All ranged infantry, including archers, crossbowmen, slingers, javelinmen, and skirmishers who primarily use ranged attacks.
* **C:** **Cavalry** - Mounted melee units, such as knights, lancers, heavy cavalry, and light cavalry.
* **H:** **Horse Archer** - Mounted ranged units, including steppe riders, mounted skirmishers, or any unit that uses a mount for mobility but primarily engages with ranged weapons.
* **M:** **Magic** - Spellcasters and arcane specialists, such as battle mages, druids, sorcerers, or healers who use magic offensively/defensively in battle.
* **B:** **Beast/Monster** - Non-human combatants like trolls, ogres, giant spiders, griffons, or units composed of/accompanied by large, trained combat beasts.
* **G:** **Siege** - Siege equipment and their specialized crews, such as trebuchets, ballistae, catapults, and battering rams, along with their engineers.
* **V:** **Naval Vessel** - Warships, patrol ships, transports.
* **VI:** **Naval Infantry** - Specialized marine detachments whose primary role is ship-to-ship combat or boarding action from a vessel

### GEAR QUALITY (Second Letter): Indicates the quality of a unit's equipment (weapons, armor, supplies).


* **B:** **Basic/Poor** - Poorly equipped, makeshift arms, very light or no armor. (e.g., peasant levies, desperate conscripts.)
* **S:** **Standard/Serviceable** - Decent arms, common leather or simple chain armor, effective but not exceptional. (e.g., town guards, regular professional soldiers, average equipment.)
* **R:** **Reinforced/Quality** - High-quality steel weapons, partial plate or reinforced chainmail/scale, well-maintained and reliable gear. (e.g., veteran soldiers, well-funded professional armies.)
* **E:** **Elite/Exceptional** - Masterwork weapons, full plate or magically enhanced armor, rare materials, top-tier equipment. (e.g., royal guards, elite knights, unique unit gear.)

### SKILL LEVEL (Third Number, 1-5): Represents a unit's training, experience, and discipline.


* **1:** **Raw/Untrained** - Minimal combat experience, poor discipline, prone to panic, easily routed.
* **2:** **Green/Basic Training** - Can follow simple commands, hold a line, but lack tactical awareness or advanced skills.
* **3:** **Seasoned/Regular** - Reliable, good performance in standard engagements, decent discipline, capable of basic maneuvers.
* **4:** **Veteran/Experienced** - Highly skilled, decisive in combat, strong discipline, can adapt to changing situations, often lead smaller groups.
* **5:** **Elite/Master** - Peak proficiency, inspirational, rarely falter even in dire circumstances, capable of complex maneuvers, top-tier individual combatants.

### Map Grid System


Aerthos is represented by a **10x10 grid**.
* **Columns (X-axis):** Labeled A through J.
* **Rows (Y-axis):** Labeled 1 through 10.
* Each cell represents approximately 800 square kilometers of territory.
* **Coordinates:** Cells are referenced using the column letter followed by the row number (e.g., `A1`, `E5`, `J10`).
* Country territories are defined by explicit lists of grid cells in the `Aerthos_Countries.txt` knowledge file. The GM will use this list to track control and movement, and players can use it to visualize geographic context.

### Aerthos Map Terrain Definitions


Aerthos's diverse landscape is categorized into specific terrain types, each represented by a unique ASCII symbol on the terrain map. These terrain types influence movement, resource availability, combat, and strategic options.


**Terrain Type Legend:**
* **~**: **Ocean** - Vast bodies of salt water surrounding the island or large internal seas. Impassable by ground units.
* **=**: **Coast** - The transitional zone where land meets a significant body of water (ocean or large lake). Crucial for ports and naval access.
* **.**: **Plains** - Flat, open, and often fertile land. Ideal for agriculture and rapid movement of large armies.
* **T**: **Forest** - Areas of dense trees and undergrowth. Provides cover, slows movement, and can offer defensive advantages.
* **M**: **Mountains** - High, rugged, and difficult terrain. Impedes movement significantly, offers strong defensive positions, and may contain mineral resources.
* **h**: **Hills** - Elevated, rolling terrain, less extreme than mountains. Offers some defensive bonuses and moderate movement penalties.
* **o**: **Lake** - An inland body of still water. Acts as a barrier, generally impassable by ground units unless frozen or special means are used.
* **r**: **River** - A flowing watercourse. Acts as a barrier requiring crossings (bridges, fords) or can be used for limited transport.
* **&**: **Island** - A small landmass surrounded entirely by water. May offer unique resources or strategic outposts.
* **_**: **Desert** - Arid, barren land with sparse vegetation. Severely impacts movement and supply.
* **v**: **Swamp/Mire** - Waterlogged, muddy terrain. Greatly impedes movement, provides excellent cover for ambushes, and can be unhealthy.
* **X**: **Wasteland/Barrens** - Desolate, resource-poor land. Difficult to traverse and sustain forces within.
